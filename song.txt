Where the light shivers offshore
Through the tides of oceans
We are shining in the rising sun

Whatever I feel for you
You only seem to care about you
Is there any chance you could see me, too?
'Cause I love you
Is there anything I could do
Just to get some attention from you?
In the waves, I've lost every trace of you
Where are you?
